Hi there! I joined Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in August 2022 as a postdoc, working under the supervision of Dr Chao Yang.
Prior to that, I obtained my PhD from Purdue University, where I was advised by Professor [Haizhao Yang](https://haizhaoyang.github.io/). Before my doctoral studies, I earned my MSc degree from the National University of Singapore and my BSc from Sun Yat-sen University.

**Research Interest:** Scientific machine learning, deep learning algorithm and interdisciplinary application.
